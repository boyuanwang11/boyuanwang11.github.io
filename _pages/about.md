Academic Research Profile:

Dr.Wang's main research directions are: (1) Artificial intelligence large language models; (2) Interdisciplinary integration of medicine with management and engineering for smart healthcare; (3) Machine learning and multi-modal LLMs; (4) AI-driven intelligent multi-source early warning systems for diseases. He has served as principal investigator or core team member in a total of six national and provincial/municipal-level research projects.

Currently, Dr.Wang is serving as Principal Investigator for the 2025 National Health Commission-National Institute of Hospital Administration (NIHA) Key Project titled "Research and Application of Fog Computing and Large Model-Driven Smart Nursing and Rehabilitation Robotics Systems: Digital Assistance System for Proactive Healthy Lifestyle Management" (Project No. SZ2024HL007). Additionally, he is a key technical contributor to the 2024 National Key R&D Program under the Science and Technology Innovation 2030-National Science and Technology Major Project (Project No. 2023ZD0505300).

In terms of academic publications, Dr.Wang has authored or co-authored over 20 peer-reviewed articles in high-impact journals such as Bioscience Trends, Journal of Medical Informatics, and Chinese Journal of Health Informatics and Management. Among these, four are first-author or corresponding-author publications in JCR Q1 SCI-indexed journals, including one accepted in npj Digital Medicine (Impact Factor = 12.7), a leading journal in the field of digital medicine and part of the Nature Portfolio. He has also contributed to three academic monographs and participated in the development of multiple information systems, supporting partner institutions in securing 11 software copyrights .In applied research, Dr.Wang played a key technical role in the design and implementation of the Guangdong Province Intelligent Multi-source Early Warning Information System (No. Yue Zheng Shu Han [2020] 727), a provincial government key project with a total investment of RMB 80 million during the pandemic. The system established a pioneering nationwide AI-based multi-source disease surveillance and early warning framework covering 41 categories of diseases and was recognized by the National Health Commission in 2022 as one of China’s Top Ten Digital Health Demonstration Cases.

Dr.Wang's technical expertise spans methodologies and algorithms in machine learning, deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and domain-specific medical modeling. As first author, his recent study titled "DeepSeek and Quen in Healthcare: Pioneering Multimodal Large Language Models for Next Generation Disease Prediction," focusing on fine-tuning large language models in healthcare applications, has been accepted by the 10th International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems (ICCCS 2025), where it received the Young Scientist Award. He has also demonstrated international collaboration experience through transnational research projects under the Belt and Road Initiative, contributing to global scientific cooperation and knowledge exchange.

2025 National Health Commission - Directly Affiliated Research Institute (Key Project)

Research on the Smart Nursing and Rehabilitation Robot System:

Research and Application of a Digital Intelligent Assistance System for Active Healthy Lifestyles

Driven by Fog Computing and Large Models (Project No. SZ2024HL007).

Project Role: Principal Investigator

Research Direction: This project centres on developing a digital nursing rehabilitation robot system, driven by fog computing and large models, to assist middle-aged and elderly individuals and chronic disease patients in managing their health proactively. It focuses on patient symptom monitoring and management, using advanced technologies to provide personalized health support and improve the quality of life for these groups. By utilizing fog computing and large models, the project aims to create a digital aid system that can offer real-time monitoring and effective management of patients' symptoms, contributing to better health outcomes.
