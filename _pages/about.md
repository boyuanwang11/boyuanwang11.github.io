As a main contributor, I designed a multi - point triggered information early warning system for 41 types of diseases, including COVID - 19, viral infectious diarrhea, pneumonia of unknown etiology, dengue fever, clonorchiasis, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, avian influenza, food - borne diseases, hand - foot - mouth disease, plague, filariasis, soil - transmitted parasitic diseases, and other vector - borne infectious diseases, which was the first of its kind in China.

- 2019–Municipal-Level Research Project

"Research on Core Technologies for Automatic Monitoring and Identification of Foodborne Diseases in Key Populations and Machine Learning Models for Early Outbreak Prediction" (Project No. 2019B1106).

Project Role: Principal Investigator

Research Direction: This study is based on the municipal regional health information platform. It focuses on automatically monitoring and identifying sporadic and outbreak foodborne diseases among key populations. It aims to automatically collect relevant disease information and integrate it with various environmental and social factors of the city, such as population, environment, school hygiene, public place hygiene, and food pollution. Then, it will use machine learning to build a large-scale prediction model for foodborne disease outbreaks among key populations, tailored to the city's geographical and social environment.

- 2017– Guangdong Provincial and Municipal Government Regional Information Platform Disease Prevention and Control System Construction Project

Project Role: Key Contributor

Research Direction: The total project scale is nearly 100 million yuan (a PPP project), involving multiple departments such as health and disease control. I am the key contributor in the疾控 system construction project. I led the framework design of the disease active monitoring system based on the municipal regional health information platform. The design concept, first proposed in a city in Guangdong Province, relies on the regional information platform to automatically obtain millions of medical case records from hospitals and community health service centers across the city. It extracts symptom monitoring information for active surveillance, enhancing the efficiency and timeliness of disease monitoring. This provides an innovative foundation for disease prediction in the Guangdong Province Smart Multi - point Triggered Disease Prevention and Control Early - warning System project and represents an application innovation for the Guangdong regional health information system.
