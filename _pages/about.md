Project Role: Task 3 Leader (Ranked 3rd)

Research Direction: This project focuses on developing a pragmatic hand function intelligent rehabilitation system tailored for hemiplegic patients, with the goal of providing personalized and efficient rehabilitation services in elderly care institutions and home environments. The research outcomes aim to enhance the rehabilitation quality of life for hemiplegic patients through the following key tasks:

   - (1) Develop multimodal data fusion technology integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to achieve precise recognition of hand movement intentions, balancing personalization and generalizability.
   - (2) Design intelligent hand function rehabilitation devices emphasizing portability and user comfort.
   - (3) Construct a large-scale hand function rehabilitation evaluation model leveraging big data analytics to generate and dynamically adjust personalized rehabilitation plans.
   - (4) Optimize and evaluate the applicability of the system in elderly care and home rehabilitation settings.
The project has been successfully submitted and has entered the defense phase, with the defense at the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology successfully completed on May 15. My role involves leading Task 3 to establish the Rehabilitation Evaluation Large Language Model and dynamic training adjustment framework.

- 2021–Guangdong Province Intelligent Multi - point Triggered Disease Prevention and Control Early Warning System Project Construction Engineering

China Top 10 Digital Health Demonstration Case System Construction Experience:

Project Role: Technical Expert

Research Direction: From November 2020 to December 2021, I was assigned to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention as a core technical member to participate in the construction of the Guangdong Intelligent Multi-point Triggered Early Warning Information System (YuezhengnumLetter [2020] No. 727, a key Guangdong Provincial Government project with an investment of 80 million yuan). I was responsible for designing the COVID-19 AI - based early warning model and carried out the development of the AI - powered multi - point triggered intelligent COVID - 19 early warning function and the multi - point triggered infectious disease early warning system. The Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention specially commended me for my work. The project was selected as one of China's Top Ten Digital Health Demonstration Cases of 2022 by the National Health Commission. As a main contributor, I designed a multi - point triggered information early warning system for 41 types of diseases, including COVID - 19, viral infectious diarrhea, pneumonia of unknown etiology, dengue fever, clonorchiasis, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, avian influenza, food - borne diseases, hand - foot - mouth disease, plague, filariasis, soil - transmitted parasitic diseases, and other vector - borne infectious diseases, which was the first of its kind in China.

- 2019–Municipal-Level Research Project

"Research on Core Technologies for Automatic Monitoring and Identification of Foodborne Diseases in Key Populations and Machine Learning Models for Early Outbreak Prediction" (Project No. 2019B1106).

Project Role: Principal Investigator

Research Direction: This study is based on the municipal regional health information platform. It focuses on automatically monitoring and identifying sporadic and outbreak foodborne diseases among key populations. It aims to automatically collect relevant disease information and integrate it with various environmental and social factors of the city, such as population, environment, school hygiene, public place hygiene, and food pollution. Then, it will use machine learning to build a large-scale prediction model for foodborne disease outbreaks among key populations, tailored to the city's geographical and social environment.

- 2017– Guangdong Provincial and Municipal Government Regional Information Platform Disease Prevention and Control System Construction Project

Project Role: Key Contributor

Research Direction: The total project scale is nearly 100 million yuan (a PPP project), involving multiple departments such as health and disease control. I am the key contributor in the疾控 system construction project. I led the framework design of the disease active monitoring system based on the municipal regional health information platform. The design concept, first proposed in a city in Guangdong Province, relies on the regional information platform to automatically obtain millions of medical case records from hospitals and community health service centers across the city. It extracts symptom monitoring information for active surveillance, enhancing the efficiency and timeliness of disease monitoring. This provides an innovative foundation for disease prediction in the Guangdong Province Smart Multi - point Triggered Disease Prevention and Control Early - warning System project and represents an application innovation for the Guangdong regional health information system.
