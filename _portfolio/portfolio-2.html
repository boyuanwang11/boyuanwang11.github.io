Dr. Boyuan Wang's research team is dedicated to developing proprietary key technologies in medical artificial intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on medical image analysis, precision medicine algorithms, and multimodal large model development. The team's core mission is to create algorithmic models and software platforms with independent intellectual property rights to support applications in clinical decision-making, disease prediction, personalized treatment planning, and health management.

The core of medical artificial intelligence (AI) technology lies in the innovation of machine learning algorithms, the enhancement of data processing capabilities, and the seamless integration with technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data analytics. These advancements have given rise to multimodal AI models that efficiently parse massive healthcare datasets, enabling precise and time-sensitive disease diagnosis. Concurrently, AI algorithms integrated with wearable devices and mobile health applications have realized real-time and personalized health monitoring. As big data and cloud computing infrastructures mature, the training and deployment of AI models will become more efficient, translating personalized medicine from a vision into reality. These efforts will effectively drive R&D in medical AI, promote the application of smart healthcare and digital wellness, enhance the quality and efficiency of healthcare services, and contribute to the construction of the Healthy China initiative.
- 1.AI Imaging Diagnosis System Based on Continual Learning Technology：
An imaging diagnosis system integrated with advanced algorithms such as Transformer technology can identify features of multiple diseases from massive medical imaging datasets and enable cross-disease continual learning, providing clinicians with high-precision auxiliary diagnostic results. Through continuous learning and optimization, the system continuously improves diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, bringing revolutionary changes to medical research and clinical practice.
- 2.Construction of Multimodal Large Models：
  - 1)Leveraging large language models (LLMs), computer vision (CV), and speech recognition technologies, construct multimodal large models capable of understanding medical literature, medical records, and clinical conversations.
  - 2)Integrate diverse data sources including medical imaging, genomics, and physiological signals to develop comprehensive health assessment models supporting full-cycle patient health management.
  - 3)Enhance model interpretability and transparency to ensure compliance and safety in medical decision-making processes.
- 3.Intelligent Medical Consultation System：
We aim to develop an intelligent medical consultation system that leverages deep fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) to comprehend both medical terminology and colloquial patient descriptions, providing comprehensive clinical decision support. Our research focuses on dual-channel text-and-speech interaction to optimize doctor-patient communication, with the goal of delivering end-to-end services including personalized health advice, symptom collection, and preliminary diagnostic recommendations. These efforts seek to enhance healthcare efficiency and patient experience.
- 4.Multi-point Triggered Early Warning and Prediction Model for Infectious/Chronic Diseases：
We aim to construct a multi-point triggered early warning and prediction model system for infectious and chronic diseases, providing multi-dimensional warning and prediction services. This system covers risk warnings for diseases and related factors, disease-specific alerts, cluster event warnings, trend forecasts, and anomaly detections for health events, offering predictive support for public health emergency response decision-making.
- 5.Medical Image Diagnosis Algorithm Based on Federated Learning：
In response to global challenges in infectious disease control, our project leverages federated learning to construct a cross-regional, multi-node network for collaborative disease prediction. This system will enable early epidemic warnings across participating regions, facilitating timely prevention and control measures and optimizing healthcare resource allocation. The predictive data and analytical reports generated will provide scientific foundations for policymakers to formulate public health strategies and interventions.
- 6."Intelligent Perception Engine & Neural Center" for Smart Cities Based on Multimodal and Public Opinion Large Models：
Utilizing cutting-edge AI technologies, this project addresses critical gaps in global pandemic management, specifically in early detection, information dissemination, and rapid response. We design a context-aware large language model that integrates public health data, real-time internet information, and historical records to support intelligent early warning systems. This framework aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of cross-regional disease prevention and management strategies.
- 7.Healthcare Misinformation Identification System Based on Large Language Models:
The project is dedicated to addressing the urgent global challenge posed by the dissemination of misinformation, aiming to construct an efficient misinformation detection system by leveraging the advantages and capabilities of advanced large language model (LLM) technologies. It employs big data and sophisticated natural language processing models to accurately identify misinformation in public health emergencies, integrating domain expertise with LLMs through collaboration with healthcare professionals, personalized LLM fine-tuning, and knowledge graph injection techniques to enhance the model’s professional adaptability in the medical field. The system ensures smooth crisis response, management, and effective communication for government agencies by using innovative technologies to distinguish between authentic and false information, providing trustworthy online content to assist the public in making informed decisions and safeguarding social order and public safety. Committed to fostering an ecosystem of deep integration between medicine and artificial intelligence, the team strives to advance medical diagnosis toward intelligence and personalization, focusing on applying the latest AI advancements to multiple dimensions such as clinical decision support systems, precision medicine solutions, and telemedicine service upgrades, with the goal of improving healthcare efficiency while ensuring patients receive more precise and safe treatment experiences.
